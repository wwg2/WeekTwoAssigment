        <p></br> Sleep paralysis goes hand in hand with this legend. As Sleep paralysis is a temporary inability to move or speak that occurs when you're
	waking up or falling asleep. It's not harmful and should pass in a few seconds or minutes, but can be very frightening. Often, people with frequently
	occurring nightmares find themselves often .Awake. in their dream however unable to physically wake up. </p>
	<p> Researchers believe sleep paralysis is caused by a disturbed rapid eye movement cycle because it mostly happens as people are falling into or
	coming out of REM sleep. During that stage, their brains normally paralyze their muscles anyway -- so they don't act out their dreams. But during
	sleep paralysis, the sleeper is awake, or half awake, and so is aware she cannot move. </p>
